# Chembl-Database-Drug-Discovery-for-RET-tyrosine-kinase-receptor-in-neuroblastoma
This project aims to use the ChEMBL Database (CDB) to curate a dataset of biological activity data of RET inhibitors compounds. Subsequently, we will construct Machine Learning Models based on this data to aid in efforts of finding better drugs against RET.
